[`Experiment`](https://www.comet.com/docs/v2/api-and-sdk/python-sdk/reference/Experiment/) are the core objects in Comet and will allow us to track training and model development. Here we have written a short function to create a new comet experiment. Note that in this setup, when hyperparameters change, you can run the `create_experiment()` function to initiate a new experiment. All experiments defined with the same `project_name` will live under that project in your Comet interface.\n",

You will experiment with the choice of optimizer and the duration for which you train your models, and see how these changes affect the network's output. Some optimizers you may like to try are [`Adam`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/optimizers/Adam?version=stable) and [`Adagrad`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/optimizers/Adagrad?version=stable).\n",
